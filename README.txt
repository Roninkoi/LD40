Tomb Robber, Ludum Dare 40
Ronin748 2017

You're a grave robber in an ancient egyptian tomb. Your task is to steal as many valuables as possible and get out before you anger the ancient spirits too much. The more you've stolen, the angrier the enemies get. 

The ankhmeter decreases every time you pick up an item. This causes you to slow down, and the enemies make more damage. The meter also replenishes with time. However, levels have a time limit. If the ankhmeter or timer goes to 0, you die.

Controls:

WASD ---------------- Move
SPACE --------------- Attack
RIGHT/LEFT ARROWS --- Rotate camera
